# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

A Tragically Soupy Tetris

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A version of Tetris with slightly modified graphics and an older version of the soundtrack that I like (and think is superior to the newer versions).

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will properly display and execute a modified version of Tetris built with pygame. It will have the core features of Tetris, along with some QoL additions like quick dropping. It will also allow for saving of your points on a local leaderboard, showing how long you managed to play. It will be executed as a regular Mac or Windows app, I might make versions for both platforms.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Basic functions of Tetris with hard dropping, rudimentary score system.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All features, including QoL updates, add music.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All of the above plus modified graphics and theming, two versions for Mac and Windows

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to start by researching how pygame itself works. With the help of a tutorial, I would hopefully be able to get the core of the game written and running properly. I will also need to research how the graphics and sound in pygame work, and how I would go about making my own to implement in my project. After that, if I have time I will attempt to compile the game for both Mac and Windows, since I know a lot of people like to use MacOS for school.
