# Tetoris

A version of the popular game Tetris programmed in Python using PyGame-CE (Community Edition) and themed around the Synth-V Kasane Teto song "Tetoris" by Hiiragi Magnetite.

I def did not need different folders for every new version change... ;-;

### ADDITIONAL NOTES:

Truthfully, I was a bit too ambitious with my original goals. Figuring out how to implement custom graphics into the game where the tetrominos should be was extremely complicated. Quick drop was also not a feature I could manage to add, given the way that I had set up the game logic following the tutorial. Despite that, I still feel that this is a better outcome to leave out the new features of Tetris, since I never really moved on from playing the Game Boy version that came out in 1989. Among the other things I had failed to implement on time was the local leaderboard function.

Instead of focusing so heavily on adding the new features in more modern functions, I settled for trying to get the theming right, and to make it sort of like a tribute to one of my favorite vocal synths to listen to. Also, the coding process itself was a little annoying. The main problem was this annoying bug I found when trying to program in the collision detection on the blocks. For whatever reason they just REFUSED to stay within bounds and kept giving me an index error because of it. I spent so long trying to fix it that I ended up moving to a different folder, and then completely rewriting those files and then comparing it to what I had before. Definitely the most enjoyable part was the music and theming part, and it was really refreshing to see something other than depressing deep blues on screen.
